# Presentation
## Points to touch upon
1. Motivation - Simulations are used in economics and especially with models these will be relevant.

Asian Tiger Growth - Gordon
ising participation rates,
 intersectoral transfers of labor, improving levels of education, and
 expanding investment rate helps contributing the 
 TFP growth is essential for the growth, with the excption of Singapore: productivity growth in the NICs is not particularly low, it is also by postwar standards, not extraordinarily high.

Population growth rates (Chinese economy)- Gordon
One child Policy started in 1980 and ended in 2015; 3 children limit in 2021
would the decline of population growth affect the output per capita in the simulation?
stimulate growth per capita in 3 scenrio: high state n= 5%, n=0% and n=-5%


3. How you did it - Intro, making the class

4. Findings - The notebook

5. Obstacles - Class simulation not corresponding to data, using dataset documentation

6. Tips for other students - make a well-structured plan beforehand of how you want your class to be put together and what you want to use this class for, the use of the class should be the core of its design.

## Planning
- Solow model introduction - Amruth (1 & 2 & 3)

- Asian Tiger Growth - Gordon ising participation rates, intersectoral transfers of labor, improving levels of education, and expanding investment rate helps contributing the TFP growth is essential for the growth, with the excption of Singapore: productivity growth in the NICs is not particularly low, it is also by postwar standards, not extraordinarily high.

- Population growth rates (Chinese economy)- Gordon One child Policy started in 1980 and ended in 2015; 3 children limit in 2021 would the decline of population growth affect the output per capita in the simulation? stimulate growth per capita in 3 scenrio: high state n= 5%, n=0% and n=-5% (4)

- Changing the s to the golden rule s - Amruth (4)

- Extrapolation - Freek (4), results of this world simulation show that the Solow model might be quite limited in its use, similar to what was argued in a 1966 paper of Caselli and Barro (Solow model not corresponding to empirical findings). Reasons in this case clear as population growth and the capital accumulation might play a too big part in determining GDP growth as growth herein might be large compared to TFP growth as defined by our dataset.

- Conclusion - Freek (5 & 6), Obstacles: Class simulation not corresponding to data, using dataset documentation and to extrapolate on. Tips for other students - make a well-structured plan beforehand of how you want your class to be put together and what you want to use this class for, the use of the class should be the core of its design. In that case, you might have already looked into the dataset before making the class etcetera.
